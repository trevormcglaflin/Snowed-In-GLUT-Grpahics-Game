Welcome to Snowed In!

User Guide:

The goal of snowed in is to get the highest number of points by jumping over the tree blocks.
Everytime you jump over a tree block, you will gain one point.

However, beware! You are about to run into a ferocious winter storm. 
Unfortunately for you, snow will accumulate on your head and make it more difficult to jump.
The more snow on your head the lower you will be able to jump, and eventually you won't be able to jump at all.
To melt snow off your head you must catch warming blocks along your journey. The magenta warming blocks
will melt a little bit of snow off your head, and if you catch a rare neonyellow warming block it will
melt all of the snow off your head letting you jump high again. 

As you continue the game, it will snow harder (resulting in higher accumulation), and the trees will come at you faster!

Keyboard commands:
space bar = jump (your jump height will depend on how much snow is on your head)
down arrow = speed up down (this will let your player move down faster, there is no way to go up faster though)
p = play game (only used at beginning of game, or after your get snowed in)

Helpful hints:
- stay ahead of the warming blocks, just because you don't have snow on you now doesn't mean you should not try to melt some off you
- take advantage of the neonyellow blocks. They are rare but they will help you get much further.
- use the down arrow often to force yourself down. This is useful for capturing warming blocks and avoiding obstacles
